    <h1>PASSWORD MANAGEMENT</h1>

  <p>To start with,everybody knows every kind of application has a security policy for which one (application developer) has to put a password function in that which secures your data to be logged in by someone else.

  However,there are some precautions that I will recommend to everybody to apply for their passcode security. Firstly, most of the applications have an automatic function as that passcode should be 8,9, or any number characters. It shall be a combination of different characters, so that no one can take a guess of it.to illustrate,follows an image,

In addition, most folks try to just put in regular alphabets or numbers so that they can easily remember which is the most common mistake. The former picture is the best example of it. As the password goes longer itâ€™s difficult to remember. According to my view, the password should be 8 characters. 

On the other hand, hacking has become a headache these days. The one and the solution to this which comes first in my is that people should change their passwords timely. Also, they should provide any particular private info to anybody regarding their account.

Lastly, there are also some password secure sites that help you to secure your passwords to get hacked or if you forget your password you can also reset it by getting a code of some numbers from your email or contact number.


So,take as many measures as you can take to secure your passwords.
