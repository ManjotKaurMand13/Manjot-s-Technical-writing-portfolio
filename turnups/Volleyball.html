    <h1>VOLLEBALL</h1>
<p>Volleyball is a mixture of volley+ball. Volleyball is my soul as I have been playing volleyball since I was in grade 11 years old. Even though I played for my school as well at city level, further at province and national level.

    Volleyball has start with basics to harder as following are category from lower to higher:
    
    Lines(2 lines at the ground makes easy for players to tackle their positions)
    Backside 
    12 player of one team
    6 as spares
    12 players to play a match 
    6 going to be opponents
    Lifter
    Smasher
    rotation (clockwise)
    
    
    Underhand
    Upperhand
    Service (smash +underhand punch by closed wist)
    Smash
    
    
    
    
    I am gonna go to two basic and extremely important strategies, they are going to be defensive or offensive.
    
    To start with offence, make sure to hit every hit. Find the weakest part of their game and hit it again and again and never let them, where are you going to hit. Always hit on random positions.

     On the other hand, defensively, try to block the area and try to ruin their blocks. Every rotation should have rotative blocks especially for front enders.
    
    
    At last, go for more and more practice.
