<h1>HTML & css</h1>

<p>
    Html & CSS
 
 
HTML- Hypertext MarkUp Language
 
Html is a standard marku[p language that we can use to create different web pages.
It do contains different elements and has structure as following:

<img src="../images/htmlstartup.png" alt="html startup">
 
 
Where in this given structure,
#  html tag or we can say any tag that has starting  <> and ending with </>.
To instance, h tag for headings, p tag for paragraphs.
 
# Html element - html element is anything from the start of the tag to its end.
 
Here is an illustration of an h1 element with an image which clearly says about what is a tag? and what type of tags? and what is an element?

<img src="../images/element.png" alt="elemets">
 
 
#html attribute- attributes are the modifiers for the element or we can provide more special information about an element.
For example, a and href attributes are used to add a lot of specialities to an element like links or images.
 
#inline element- Inline elements are those which never start on a new line and these elements are used where they are necessary.
E.g. This a <span> element inside a paragraph
 
#Block elements-Block elements are the opposite of the inline elements. These elements always start on a new line.
E.g. <div> <p><footer> <form> <h1-h6>
 
 CSS cascading style sheet
 
Html is not to create a website or a web page, there is also a need to style them. Css is used to style web pages and different sites. We get to know where to put elements on the page by css.
 
For example,
 Head { 
background -colour: blue;
Margin: 10px;
Padding: 10px;
text -align: centre;
}
 
CSS Rules- Css rules consist of a selector and declaration block.

Where h1 or we can take an example of any that we want to design is a selector.
 
#CSS value-we use different values in css declaration as value of height or width and Margin or Padding.
 
In the end, html and css is not that difficult if we will everything step by step.
